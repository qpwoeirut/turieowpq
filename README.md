# turieowpq

This is a repo with the code for qpwoeirut's spambot named turi.
Only the `main.py` will be of any interest since the other stuff was me trying and failing to set up the bot on Heroku.

Obviously the `.env` file isn't in the repository since it's secret.
But you're welcome to create a new bot that uses this source code if you want.
