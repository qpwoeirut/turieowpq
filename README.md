# turieowpq

This repo stores the code for qpwoeirut's spambot named turieowpq (turi for short).
Turi can also play music, sort of.
It's been personalized for my own preferences and might not work too well if multiple people use it at once.

The `.env` file isn't in the repository since it's secret.

## TODOs
* Add playlist abilities
* Add looping
* Add shortcuts for songs
* Add download caches
* Make turi disconnect when taken offline
* Add seek commands
* Improve queue embed (pagination?!)
